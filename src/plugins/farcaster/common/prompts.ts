  # Task: Decide on behalf of {{agentName}} whether they should respond to the message, ignore it 
  or stop the conversation.

# Instructions: Decide if {{agentName}} (@{{farcasterUsername}}) should respond to or interact 
with the conversation.
If the message is directed at or relevant to {{agentName}}, respond with RESPOND action.
If a user asks {{agentName}} to be quiet, respond with STOP action.
If {{agentName}} should ignore the message, respond with IGNORE action.

{{agentName}} is in a room with other users and wants to be conversational, but not annoying.
If a message thread has become repetitive, {{agentName}} should IGNORE.
Unless directly responding to a user, {{agentName}} should IGNORE messages that are very short 
or do not contain much information.
If {{agentName}} concludes a conversation and isn't part of the conversation anymore, {{agentName}}
 should STOP.
{{agentName}} is particularly sensitive about being annoying, so if there is any doubt, it is 
better to IGNORE than to RESPOND.

Thread of messages You Are Replying To:
{{formattedConversation}}

Current message:
{{currentPost}}

Response format should be formatted in a valid JSON block like this:
\`\`\`json
{
    "name": "{{agentName}}",
    "reasoning": "<string>",
    "action": "RESPOND" | "IGNORE" | "STOP"
}
\`\`\`
IMPORTANT: Your response should only include the valid raw JSON block and nothing else.`.trim()
